## 💝 Customization Guide

### **Changing the Message Content**

The beauty of this project lies in its **complete customizability**. You can easily personalize every aspect of the message to express your unique thoughts and feelings.

**Step 1: Edit the Main Message**
Open `index.html` and find the message content section:

```html
<div class="container" id="messageBox">
    <h1>🌟 To My Amazing Friends 🌟</h1>
    <p>
        <!-- Replace this entire message with your own heartfelt content -->
        I just want to take a moment to express my gratitude for each of you.
        Your friendship is a constant source of joy, strength, and comfort in my life.
        Through every challenge and every celebration, you've been there,
        and that means more to me than words can fully capture.
        
        <!-- Add your own paragraphs, memories, inside jokes, etc. -->
        No matter where life takes us, I hope we always remain connected, 
        supporting each other and creating new memories together. 
        You are truly invaluable, and I am lucky to have you in my life.
    </p>
    <div class="signature">
        With all my love and appreciation,<br>
        <!-- Change this to your name -->
        Your Friend ❤️
    </div>
</div>
```

**Creative Ideas for Your Message:**
- Share specific memories you cherish together
- Mention inside jokes that will make them smile
- Express what their friendship means to you during difficult times
- Include hopes and dreams for your future friendship
- Add quotes that represent your bond
- Write in multiple languages if applicable

### **Personalizing the Design**

**Colors & Theme** - Modify `style.css`:
```css
/* Background Gradient - Change these colors */
body {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, #your-color1, #your-color2);
}

/* Message Box Colors */
.container {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95); /* Change transparency/color */
}

/* Text Colors */
h1 {
    color: #your-heading-color;
}
```

**Animation Speed & Effects**:
```css
/* Bubble Animation Speed */
.bubble {
    animation: rise 10s infinite linear; /* Change 10s to your preference */
}

/* Gift Box Hover Effect */
.gift-box:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1) rotate(10deg); /* Adjust scale and rotation */
}
```

### **Adding Your Own Music**

Replace or add background music:

1. **Add your music file** to the project folder
2. **Update the HTML** in `index.html`:
```html
<audio id="bgMusic" loop preload="auto">
    <source src="your-music-file.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="your-music-file.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>
```

3. **Adjust volume** in `script.js`:
```javascript
bgMusic.volume = 0.2; // Change from 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (full volume)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Interactive Envelope System**
The project uses event-driven JavaScript to create the magical reveal effect:

```javascript
function showMessage(icon) {
    // Hide the envelope with smooth transition
    icon.style.display = 'none';
    
    // Reveal message with animation
    const messageBox = document.getElementById('messageBox');
    messageBox.classList.add('show');
    
    // Play background music (if available)
    const bgMusic = document.getElementById('bgMusic');
    if (bgMusic) {
        bgMusic.volume = 0.2;
        bgMusic.play().catch(err => {
            console.warn("Autoplay might be blocked by the browser.", err);
        });
    }
}
```

### **Animated Bubble System**
CSS keyframe animations create the mesmerizing floating effect:

```css
@keyframes rise {
    0% {
        bottom: -100px;
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateX(0) scale(1);
    }
    30% {
        opacity: 1;
    }
    100% {
        bottom: 120%;
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateX(-30px) scale(1.5);
    }
}
```
